# Large TypeScript Monorepo

This is a large TypeScript monorepo that contains multiple packages. Each package is located in the `packages` directory and has its own `package.json` file. 

## Purpose

This is entirely AI generated using `Codex-5.3-Spark` for testing purposes. The monorepo is designed to stress test TypeScript compilers

## How it was generated

See [`generate.sh`](./scripts/generate.sh) for the script that was used to generate this monorepo. 

## Project Graph

See [`GRAPH.md`](./GRAPH.md) for the TypeScript project-reference graph generated from `tsconfig.json` by [`scripts/graph.sh`](./scripts/graph.sh).
